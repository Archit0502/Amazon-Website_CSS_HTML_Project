# Amazon-Website_CSS_HTML_Project

ðŸ›’ Amazon.com Clone (HTML & CSS)
A front-end clone of the Amazon.com website built entirely with **HTML and CSS**.  
This project replicates Amazonâ€™s homepage design, including a responsive layout, navigation bar, search section, product grid, and footer.  
It is created for practicing **web design, layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid), and UI styling**.  
No backend functionality (cart, login, payments) is included â€” this project is strictly for **learning and portfolio purposes**.
